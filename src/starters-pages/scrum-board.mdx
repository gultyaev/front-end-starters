title: "Scrum board"
description: "A project where you can build a simplified version of Jira/Trello. It will feature sign in and sign up, API endpoints requiring authentication, columns and tickets creation, update, removal and tickets reorder. For a better user experience of transitioning tickets between columns and reorders you will need to add the drag n drop feature."
complexity: "med"
prerequisites:
  - "Basic knowledge of AWS (have an account and know how to create creds for AWS CLI)"
type: "starter"

## What you will build

A scrum board (similar to Jira/Trello). There will be columns and tickets in them.
Tickets can be reordered in a column as well as be moved from column to column.
To improve the UX you could add a drag n drop capabilities.

## What you will learn

- How to authenticate with JWT
- How to make HTTP requests to a RESTful API service
- How to work with OpenAPI specs
- How to make authenticated requests
- (optionally) Drag n drop with subsequent requests

## Learning the available API endpoints for the project

When you launch local development server you'll see a link in the console leading to `/docs` page with OpenAPI specs served.

## API excerpts

### Board

```
{
  "columns": [
    {
      "tasks": [
        {
          "id": "string",
          "title": "string",
          "description": "string",
          "columnId": "string"
        }
      ],
      "id": "string",
      "title": "string"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Reorder tasks

This requires you to submit all ids of a column in a desired order.

```
{
  "ids": [
    "string"
  ]
}
```

### Update a task

```
{
  "id": "string",
  "title": "string",
  "description": "string",
  "columnId": "string"
}
```

### Moving a task into another column

Make the `PUT /tasks` request with the task's data and change the `columnId` to the destination column.
To preserve the order same as in the UI make a subsequent request `/tasks/reorder` with the destination column
ids in the desired order.

## Tech stack

The server can be run as locally as remotely by deploying to AWS using Serverless framework. The project is supposed to fall under Free Tier/Always Free Tier resources (to avoid payment for pet project).

The API is deployed to the AWS using Serverless framework. It will create:

- CloudFormation stack to create all required resources
- Lambda functions exposed under single API gateway
- DynamoDB database to store the data

This should fall into the AWS Free Tier limitations.

After 12 month of AWS Free Tier you will be chared for S3 Bucket resource, though the charge should be low you can always remove all created resources (see "Remove the service" section).

This is not a production ready project, so don't put in any sensitive data as it may be exposed.
