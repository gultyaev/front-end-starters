Sometimes developers tend to write code in a verbose way.

```
function isNameValid(name) {
  if (name.includes('#')) {
    return false;
  }

  return true;
}
```

Despite it does the job it's better to simplify the code.

```
function isNameValid(name) {
  return !name.includes('#');
}
```

With a simple change it becomes less verbose, more readable and does the same job.
