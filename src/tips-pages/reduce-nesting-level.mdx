Developers like to approach code writing in the way of thinking. By doing so the following constructions
appear.

```
class UserService {
  #initialized = false;

  init() {
    if (!this.#initialized) {
      // run init logic
    }
  }
}
```

Notice something odd here? We have only one if statement that surrounds all method's logic.
For simple methods it may be not be a big problem, but as the complexity grows it becomes harder
to follow the code as it continues to increase nesting level.

Instead, it's better to rewrite it in the next way.

```
class UserService {
  #initialized = false;

  init() {
    if (this.#initialized) { // <-- swap the condition and return
      return;
    }

    // run init logic
  }
}
```

This way the code is less nested and easier to follow.
