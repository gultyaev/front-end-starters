Simple functions are easy to read and use. When a function starts to have more than 3 arguments it becomes much harder
to use it correctly, read and understand it. Take the following example that tracks users' activity.

```javascript
function track(userId, action, page, element) { /* some implementation details */ }

track(1, 'pay', 'checkout', '#pay-btm');
```

It's relatively easy to read it when you have the function and the usage side by side, but what if you want to use it
some time later? Most probably you won't remember how to use it. Furthermore, it may need more options in the future
and some of the old ones may become optional, then it would require some refactoring to adjust the logic to the new realities.

It's considered a better approach to accept arguments as an object instead. This way, the function call contains
one or a couple of arguments, and the object can increase the number of options with time without any need to
refactor existing usages! Moreover, function call becomes easier to read.

```javascript
track({
  userId: 1,
  action: 'pay',
  page: 'checkout',
  element: '#pay-btm'
});
```
